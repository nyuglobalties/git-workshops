Too often we get trapped in the "final_final_v#" problem when collaborating that .red[we don't know which file is the _actual_ final one].

**This is where version control comes in.**

**.red[Box]** implements a **centralized scheme**: there is only .red[one source of truth] and .red[one history for each file]. 

When working on your own with one file, this is generally okay, but when you start collaborating on the same file, you might end up with the situation on the right.
