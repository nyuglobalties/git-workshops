> Welcome to **Let's Write a Paper**, a collaborative workshop series about using **`git`** and [**GitHub**](https://github.com) for paper writing and other non-code uses! We'll go over git, GitHub, common workflows, and ultimately how you could write your papers (and other documents) using these tools. No coding experience expected!

This series of workshops is inspired by the amazing [**Git and GitHub for Poets**](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/git-and-github/) series by The Coding Train ([Prof. Daniel Shiffman](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/itp/1984778605) of NYU Tisch ITP). Rather than working on poems, we'll write a (fake) paper together -- leveraging the powers of git and GitHub.

## Setup

While installation is required ahead of time (we'll go through it together), here's a list of software that we will use throughout the series:

- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): A GUI interface to git
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): An extremely versatile text editor

Later in the series, we will use these:

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/): Handy tool to write documents in a versionable way
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): Everyone's favorite citation manager!
