# Merging

Collaboration is only useful if we are able to combine our work on our different branches. We achieve this using a git **merge**

.definition[

## Merge

A mechanism that takes two (or more) histories and reconciles the differences in a line-wise fashion.

]

We've already used a mechanism that implements a merge before, and that's the **Pull Request** feature on Github! However, Pull Requests are really some nice window dressing around merges, and sometimes it's useful to merge work _outside_ of the context of a Pull Request.

# Merging

Consider this example:

.pull-left[

I'm working on a particular section of a report, and things are going swimmingly. However, I noticed that something in your analysis would be very nice to include in my report, but your analysis work was already merged into `main` via a Pull Request. 

How can I get your analysis work into my branch so I can make the changes in my report prior to creating a PR?
