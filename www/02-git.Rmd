# Moving Around

Learning how to use a terminal shell is a whole workshop series on its own. I just want to showcase **basic file system operations**.

- **`cd <dir>`**: Move to another folder ("Change directory")
- **`pwd`**: show where you are currently located -- your _working directory_ ("Print working directory")
- **`ls [-l, -a] [dir]`**: List the contents of your working directory _or_ of some other directory `dir`
- **`cat <file>`**: Print the contents of a file to your terminal screen
- **`mkdir [-p] <dir>`**: Creates a folder with path `dir` (`-p` signals if you'd like to recursively create folders if `dir` has multiple missing folders)
- **`rm [-r, -f] <path>`**: Removes a `path` (recursively with `-r`)
- **`mv <from> <to>`**: Move/rename a file/folder at `from` to `to`

These seven commands will cover most of what you need to do outside of `git` in most cases.

# Loading up Terminal...

???

- Discuss how this is what a shell looks like on Mac and other UNIX-likes; for Windows, recommend the WSL or Git Bash
- List the contents of ~ with just `cd` and `cd ~`
- List with `ls -l` and `ls -la`; talk about `.` and `..`
- Move around with `cd`; showcase utility of `cd ..` and `cd -` with `pwd` and TAB COMPLETION and dragging folders from Finder to a `cd` command
- Go back to ~, create a folder, delete it
- Create ~/worksapce and rename to ~/workspace with `mv`
- `cd ~/workspace`

# Onto git...

# Working Locally

Using Github as an editor is _okay_ if you're doing quick fixes, e.g. documentation improvements that just need a couple word changes. The downsides to working exclusively with Github are that:

1. You have to have an internet connection at all times
1. You cannot use any of the tools that you have on your computer

This is clearly not ideal when you're writing papers and may need to regenerate figures, tables, etc.

This is where **`git`** comes in. **.red[`git` is what you work with on _your_ computer].** 

By default, `git` is a command line tool. However, I'll be showing you how to work with the command line interface _and_ an application called "SourceTree" that makes it easier to visualize what's going on.
